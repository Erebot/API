/**
 * \brief
 *      An exception thrown whenever PHP raises a notice, warning, etc.
 *
 * This is an implementation of a custom exception which turns
 * all PHP messages (errors, warnings, notices, etc.) into exceptions.
 * We use this exception instead of PHP's ErrorException because the
 * latter is buggy under PHP 5.2, which might be a target version for
 * Erebot at some time.
 * Original implementation proposed by luke at cywh dot com:
 * http://php.net/manual/en/class.errorexception.php#89132
